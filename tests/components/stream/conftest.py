"""Test fixtures for the stream component.

The tests encode stream (as an h264 video), then load the stream and verify
that it is decoded properly. The background worker thread responsible for
decoding will decode the stream as fast as possible, and when completed
clears all output buffers. This can be a problem for the test that wishes
to retrieve and verify decoded segments. If the worker finishes first, there is
nothing for the test to verify. The solution is the WorkerSync class that
allows the tests to pause the worker thread before finalizing the stream
so that it can inspect the output.
