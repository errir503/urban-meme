set_central_heating_ovrd:
  name: Set central heating override
  description: >
    Set the central heating override option on the gateway.
    When overriding the control setpoint (via a set_control_setpoint service call with a value other than 0), the gateway automatically enables the central heating override to start heating.
    This service can then be used to control the central heating override status.
    To return control of the central heating to the thermostat, call the set_control_setpoint service with temperature value 0.
    You will only need this if you are writing your own software thermostat.
